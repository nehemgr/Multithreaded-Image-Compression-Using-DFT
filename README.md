# Multithreaded-Image-Compression-Using-DFT
This project focuses on building an image compressor executable that implements multithreading to leverage the system's resources. This is done in a thread-safe and data-safe manner by the use of appropriate mutexes. The user enters the total number of threads the system must use, the compression factor (a value between 1 to 10) and the source and destination image file names. A separate file is included that performs exactly the same, but sequentially and the comparisons are provided. The focus here is only to multithread the calculation of the DFTs of smaller 16x16 sub-images, and hence the DFT calcuations were implemented using the exisiting FFTW libraries.
